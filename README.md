# House-Price-Predication-using-ML

## Project Overview

This project predicts house prices using machine learning. It features:
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **Frontend:** React (JavaScript)
- **Data Analysis & Model Training:** Jupyter Notebook

---

## Workflow

1. **Data Analysis & Model Training**
    - Use Jupyter Notebook for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
    - Export the trained model (e.g., as a `.pkl` file).

2. **Backend (Flask)**
    - Serve the trained model via REST API endpoints.
    - Handle prediction requests from the frontend.

3. **Frontend (React)**
    - User interface for inputting house features.
    - Sends requests to the Flask backend and displays predicted prices.

## Getting Started

### 1. Jupyter Notebook
- Run data analysis and train your ML model.
- Save the trained model for use in the backend.

### 2. Flask Backend
- Load the trained model.
- Expose prediction endpoints (e.g., `/predict`).

### 3. React Frontend
- Build forms for user input.
- Fetch predictions from the backend and display results.
